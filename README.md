# PenCut

You probably heard of Samsung's new Galaxy Note10.

You wanted to flex on your friends/try out the Note10 very early.

Well, you 100% won't get a unit to test it. **And now, you don't need to!**

Introducing **PenCut, a simulation of the Galaxy S10's camera hole for any Android device**, so you could feel how it's like.

_If you didn't read the small text on the bottom of the repo name, this is a fork of [TenCut](https://github.com/githubcatw/TenCut), which itself is a fork of [XOutOf10](https://github.com/idoideas/XOutOf10)._

## Download

You can [download the latest APK right here](https://github.com/githubcatw/TenCut/blob/master/tencut.apk?raw=true).

Supports all Android versions, all the way back to 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich).

**Android 6.0+ Users**: In your first run, please make sure you permit drawing over apps.

**Android 8.0 (Oreo) users:** Please note that the hole will be hidden when you expand your status bar. That occurs due to API limitations set by Google.

## How to enable

1. Download and install the app.
2. If it's your first time and you're running Android 6.0+, tap on the "Permit Drawing Over Apps" button and allow it.
3. Click on "Start".

**To stop the simulation, click on "Stop" within the app.**

## Screenshots

Tested on Galaxy S8. **Screenshots are outdated and show the A8s simulation.**
