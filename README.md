# TenCut
**WARNING: This app simulates the S10/S10e hole-punch display. Earlier versions simulated A8s, and most of the app needs a rewrite to add S10+ hole simulation!**

You saw Unpacked 2019. You probably heard of Samsung's new Galaxy S10.

You probably noticed the large camera hole on the S10 (and the even larger one on the S10+).

Your friends who got the S10 probably said it's not that noticeable, and that you haven't tried it yourself.

Well, you won't pay $899 just to test it (and you've got a good phone already, so no point in upgrading). **And now, you don't need to!**

Introducing **TenCut, a simulation of the Galaxy S10's camera hole for any Android device**, so you could feel how it's like.

_If you didn't read the small text on the bottom of the repo name, this is a fork of [XOutOf10](https://github.com/idoideas/XOutOf10)._

## Download

You can [download the latest APK right here](https://github.com/githubcatw/TenCut/blob/master/tencut.apk?raw=true).

Supports all Android versions, all the way back to 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich).

**Android 6.0+ Users**: In your first run, please make sure you permit drawing over apps.

**Android 8.0 (Oreo) users:** Please note that the hole will be hidden when you expand your status bar. That occurs due to API limitations set by Google.

## How to enable

1. Download and install the app.
2. If it's your first time and you're running Android 6.0+, tap on the "Permit Drawing Over Apps" button and allow it.
3. Click on "Start".

**To stop the simulation, click on "Stop" within the app.**

## Screenshots

Tested on Galaxy S8. **Screenshots are outdated and show the A8s simulation.**
